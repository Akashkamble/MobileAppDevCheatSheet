StaticLayout 
used to draw text on canvas with autowrapping facility, 
because canvas.drawText doesn't considers the bounds and so the text is off the screen. 

LiveWallaper (Create)
class YourLiveWallpaper extends WallpaperService{
  constructor{
    timerTask{
      draw()
    }
  }

  void draw(){
    Canvas canvas = getSurfaceView().canvas
    staticLayout.draw(canvas)
  }
}
