Looper - It runs multiple task simultaneously on a single thread

Keystore is used to store sensitive data like password.It is difficult to extract from device.
Steps - 
Get the instance of Key Generator and mention the type of the algo that u want to use like AES/DES.
Set properties of key using KeyGenParameterSpec
Init KeyGeneratoer
Get the Cipher instance
Use that cipher for encryption	

Alarm Manager - If you want to run some piece of code at particular time

Dagger - 
BindInstance - To get the available data before building component.
Module - Class which having provider methods
Scope - To make object that can be live as long as your activity lives or application lives.eg. ActivityScope,ApplicationScope
Qualifier - If you want multiple instances of same class.
Component - It is interface of abstract class in which all modules are mentioned.
Inject - Tell the dagger to get the instance of requested class from dagger graph.

Cold Observable - It does not emits the data/item until subscribers subscribes.
Hot Observable - It emits the items

Association - Relationship bet 2 different classes
Composition and Agrregation are 2 forms of Association 

Polymorphism - Single action can be performed in multiple	ways.
 
Compile Time Polymorphism - Overloading -> Type of the object is determine at compile time
Run time/Dynamic Polymorphism - Overriding -> Type of the object is determine at run time

Fragment popbackstack - 
mgr.popbackstack() - removes the top fragment from the stack
Mgr.popBackstack(tag,FragmentManager.POP_BACK_STACK_INCLUSIVE) - removes the fragment having tag which you have mentioned
Mgr..popBackStackImmediate(3, FragmentManager.POP_BACK_STACK_INCLUSIVE) - similar to above.

PopbackstackImmediate() - perform the popping command immediately in the call before the function returns.
PopBackstack() - perform the popping command within the next event loop cycle(slightly later)

Pull to refresh - SwipeRefreshLayout is use

Thread will not work if your application is not active.Hence we use service for that.

finishAffinity() is not used to "shutdown an application". It is used to remove a number of Activity s belonging to a specific application from the current task

To Call Parent Fragment method from Child Fragment ->
ParentFragment parentFrag = ((ParentFragment)ChildFragment.this.getParentFragment());
       parentFrag.someMethod();
  -  Use interface,Event Bus
  -  ((YourParentFragment) getParentFragment()).parentFragmentMethod();

For Device Root Check - 
Use SafetyNet API of google.
It provides below api’s - 
1] SafetyNet attestation API - to check device is rooted or not, also check app is running on emulator or not.Here snet service is running in the background which sends device information to the server.
2] SafetyNet reCaptcha api - to check human is interacting with your app or not.
3] Safetynet safe browsing API - It checks the web page that u r browsing contains the malicious content or not.
4]SafetyNet verify app API - It checks whether your application contains the code which breaks the Android security.

Steps to use SafetNet - 
1] Login in to Google Developer Console.Create Project with pkg name.Enable Android Device verification.
2]Generate API key using pkg name
3] Include dependency in gradle.
4] Add metadata in Android Manifest and include api key as a value
5] Set connection to google play services
6] Generate the nonse (one time token)
7] Create compatibility request.you will get JWS(Json Web Signature) response from server.
8] Decode it to simple JSON object.From this json you have to read value of ctsProfileMatch and basicIntegrity.As both are boolean values.If both are true then your device pass the safety net test.

ctsProfileMatch check your device is rooted or not.also check app is running on emulator or not.

basicIntegrity - It will return false if your device is tampered I.e. custom ROM,BootLoader is enable.


While moving from Activity 1 to Activity 2 following methods called in order to -

onPause - Activity 1
OnCrate - Activity 2
onStart - Activity 2
onResume - Activity 2
onStop - Activity 1


To insert complex object in Room - 
@Embedded is used
@TypeConverter is used if field is list type(It convert list into primitive type and vice versa)
Eg. @TypeConverters(DataTypeConverter.class)
    private List<MyListObject> mList = null;
@Relation - Used to handle relations like one to one, one to many


addOnBackStackChangeListener callback is called while adding and removing fragment.

setRetainInstance(true) is use in fragment if we want the fragment will not destroy if activity is destroy and recreated while config changes.

FragmentPagerAdapter - It store the each fragment in memory which is visited by user.Only view is destroyed when fragment is invisible. Used if we want to store whole fragment into memory. 

FragmentStatePagerAdapter - Fragment instance is destroyed when it is invisible to the user.Used if we have dynamic fragment like fragment with widgets.

Adapters - Responsible for converting each entry to view.

commit() - Synchronous and returns boolean
apply() - Asynchronous and does not returns anything

To reduce build time - 
org.gradle.daemon = true
org.gradle.confingureondemand = true
Increase heap size
org.gradle.parallel = true


ViewPager2 -
Vertical Orientation
Moved from PagerAdpter to RecyclerView.Adapter
Better control over Animation
Smart Page Change listener


Camera X - 
It is life cycle aware 
You can bind it by using CameraX.bindToLifeCycle()

Maps API 
update map realtime signalR 

DS 
binarytree 
linkedlist 

java thread lifecycle

recyclerview 
diff utils

Activity has frame layout, we add First fragment, add 2nd fragment not in backstack, rotate device, replace 3rd fragment, Note down life cycle methods with back click events
Explain working of Google app update (i.e When you have multiple applications to update & you click the fifth app to update, then it moves to first position, then starts download progress, then moves out of the list after installation is complete)

Java Programs
Factorial
Duplicate numbers in ArrayList // 2, 0, 0, 1, 6, 9, 2, 7 => 2, 0

Can we use LiveData in Repository layer?

Scenario
Single activity fragments, first fragment shows list of movies with pagination of 10 records only, scroll till 5 page, click on 50th row, replace 
Frame layout with second fragment, click back event, note down the lifecycle methods called & on when back on first fragment, show 50th row only
Show vertical list in one fragment, on orientation change show different fragment with GridView list.
